# Flask

## Before Flask

- **Website:** Collection of web pages accessible via browser

- **Web Application:** Software accessed through a web browser that offers dynamic, interactive features similar to a desktop application but without requiring installation

- **Server:** A computer or program that hosts web pages or web applications and responds to requests from clients (browsers) over the internet

- **Frontend:** The part of a website or web app that users interact with directly, usually built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- **Backend:** The part of a web app that handles data processing, database management, authentication, and business logic; usually runs on a server

- **Python Limitation: Web Development:** Python alone cannot handle HTTP requests, render HTML, or manage databases efficiently without additional tools or frameworks

- **Frameworks:** Pre-built libraries and tools that make web development easier and faster, e.g., Flask, Django, FastAPI

- **Flask Benefits:** Lightweight, easy to learn, flexible, minimal boilerplate code, allows building web apps quickly, extensible with plugins for databases, authentication, and more
